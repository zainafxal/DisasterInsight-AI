## üìå Overview
[**Try Live Web App**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zainafxal/disaster-insight-webapp)

During a natural disaster, information is chaotic. Emergency responders, NGOs, and governments are flooded with unstructured data from social media while trying to anticipate where the next high-impact event might occur. **DisasterInsight AI** was built to solve this problem by providing a unified platform that filters the noise from real-time data streams, quantifies risk based on historical patterns, and provides strategic forecasts to enable proactive planning.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

This platform integrates four distinct AI models and a live data feed into a single, cohesive user experience.

*   **üåê Real-Time Signal Analysis:** An NLP Transformer model classifies live social media text into 10 humanitarian categories, identifying critical information as it emerges.
*   **üìà Predictive Risk Planning:** An XGBoost model assesses the potential severity of a disaster event, providing a data-driven risk probability based on historical data.
*   **üìä Forecasting Suite:**
    *   **Strategic Global Forecast:** A Prophet time-series model provides a long-term forecast of global earthquake frequency, establishing a baseline for "normal" activity.
    *   **Tactical Regional Forecast:** A specialized XGBoost model predicts the near-term probability of a high-impact earthquake in four of the world's most vulnerable regions.
*   **üì° Live Global Monitoring:** An integrated, real-time feed from the USGS API displays significant earthquake events as they happen around the globe.
*   **üñ•Ô∏è Professional Dashboard:** A polished, branded, and fully responsive **React** frontend with an intuitive dark mode and modern, interactive visualizations.

## üìë Reports & Documentation

This repository includes comprehensive documentation for both end-users and developers.

*   **Project Summary Report:** A high-level overview of the project's objectives, methodology, and key results.
    > ‚û°Ô∏è **[Read the Full Project Report](./reports/PROJECT_SUMMARY_REPORT.md)**

*   **Model Performance Reports:** In-depth analysis of each of the four AI models, including metrics, confusion matrices, and feature importance.
    > ‚û°Ô∏è **[View Model Performance Reports](./reports/model_performance/)**

*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Reports on the initial data analysis that informed our modeling strategies.
    > ‚û°Ô∏è **[View EDA Reports](./reports/eda/)**

*   **Dashboard User Guide:** A detailed walkthrough of all features in the live web application.
    > ‚û°Ô∏è **[Read the User Guide](./disaster-insight-frontend/docs/USER_GUIDE.md)**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

To run the entire platform locally, you will need to set up the backend and frontend separately.

### **Prerequisites**
- Git
- Conda / Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+

### **1. Set Up the Data & Models**
The models and notebooks require training data which is not included in this repo.

‚û°Ô∏è Follow the instructions in the [data/README.md](data/README.md) to download the necessary datasets. The trained models are located in the `models/` directory.

### **2. Run the Backend API**
The backend API serves the models from the models directory.

‚û°Ô∏è Follow the setup instructions in the [disaster-insight-api/README.md](disaster-insight-api/README.md) to run the FastAPI server.

### **3. Run the Frontend Dashboard**
The frontend is the user-facing application.

‚û°Ô∏è Follow the setup instructions in the [disaster-insight-frontend/README.md](disaster-insight-frontend/README.md) to run the React app.
