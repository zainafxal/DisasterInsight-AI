## 📌 Overview

During a natural disaster, information is chaotic. Emergency responders, NGOs, and governments are flooded with unstructured data from social media while trying to anticipate where the next high-impact event might occur. **DisasterInsight AI** was built to solve this problem by providing a unified platform that filters the noise from real-time data streams, quantifies risk based on historical patterns, and provides strategic forecasts to enable proactive planning.

---

## ✨ Key Features

This platform integrates four distinct AI models and a live data feed into a single, cohesive user experience.

*   **🌐 Real-Time Signal Analysis:** An NLP Transformer model classifies live social media text into 10 humanitarian categories, identifying critical information as it emerges.
*   **📈 Predictive Risk Planning:** An XGBoost model assesses the potential severity of a disaster event, providing a data-driven risk probability based on historical data.
*   **📊 Forecasting Suite:**
    *   **Strategic Global Forecast:** A Prophet time-series model provides a long-term forecast of global earthquake frequency, establishing a baseline for "normal" activity.
    *   **Tactical Regional Forecast:** A specialized XGBoost model predicts the near-term probability of a high-impact earthquake in four of the world's most vulnerable regions.
*   **📡 Live Global Monitoring:** An integrated, real-time feed from the USGS API displays significant earthquake events as they happen around the globe.
*   **🖥️ Professional Dashboard:** A polished, branded, and fully responsive **React** frontend with an intuitive dark mode and modern, interactive visualizations.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

To run the entire platform locally, you will need to set up the backend and frontend separately.

### Prerequisites
- Git
- Conda / Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+

### 1. Set Up the Data & Models
The models and notebooks require training data which is not included in this repo.

➡️ Follow the instructions in the `data/README.md` to download the necessary datasets. The trained models are located in the `models/` directory.

### 2. Run the Backend API
The backend API serves the models from the models directory.

➡️ Follow the setup instructions in the `disaster-insight-api/README.md` to run the FastAPI server.

### 3. Run the Frontend Dashboard
The frontend is the user-facing application.

➡️ Follow the setup instructions in the `disaster-insight-frontend/README.md` to run the React app.
