## üì¶ Models Served

This API provides access to four pre-trained models:

1.  **Tweet Classifier (M1):** Classifies disaster-related tweets into humanitarian categories. *(Built with Transformers)*
2.  **Static Risk Predictor (M2):** Assesses disaster event risk based on historical features. *(Built with Scikit-learn / XGBoost)*
3.  **Earthquake Frequency Forecaster (M3):** Provides long-term global earthquake frequency forecasts. *(Built with Prophet)*
4.  **Regional Impact Forecaster (M4):** Predicts short-term impact probability for specific regions. *(Built with XGBoost)*

---

## üìÇ API Endpoints Summary

*   `POST /api/v1/classify-tweet`: Classifies a single tweet.
*   `POST /api/v1/predict-risk`: Predicts the static risk of a disaster event.
*   `GET  /api/v1/global-earthquake-forecast`: Retrieves the global earthquake frequency forecast.
*   `POST /api/v1/predict-regional-impact`: Forecasts next-quarter impact probability for specific high-risk regions.

*Full request and response schemas are available in the Swagger UI.*

## üõ† Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** FastAPI, Uvicorn
*   **ML Libraries:** Transformers, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Prophet
*   **Deployment:** Hugging Face Spaces (via Docker)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

*   The models are trained on specific historical datasets and should not be used as a replacement for official emergency services.
*   Forecasts are statistical probabilities, not deterministic predictions of specific events.
*   The Regional Impact Forecaster (M4) is only validated for **China, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines**.
