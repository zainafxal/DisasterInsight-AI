## 🏗️ Architecture: A Decoupled System

DisasterInsight AI operates on a modern, decoupled three-tier architecture. This frontend is the presentation layer, communicating with a dedicated backend service that handles all complex processing.

```text
+----------------+      +---------------------------+      +-----------------------+
|                |      |                           |      |                       |
|   React User   | ---> |     FastAPI Backend       | ---> |    AI / ML Models     |
|   Interface    |      | (on Hugging Face Spaces)  |      |   (NLP, XGBoost, etc.)|
|                |      |                           |      |                       |
+----------------+      +---------------------------+      +-----------------------+
This decoupled approach ensures scalability and maintainability. The frontend handles all user interactions and data visualization, while the backend manages the heavy lifting of AI model inference.

## 🛠️ Getting Started: Running Locally

Follow these instructions to get the frontend up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or newer)
*   `npm` or `yarn` package manager

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/disaster-insight-frontend.git
    cd disaster-insight-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    This application needs to know the URL of the backend API. Create a new file in the root directory named `.env.local`.
    ```
    touch .env.local
    ```
    Open the file and add the following line. This points the app to the live, deployed backend.
    ```env
    REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://zainafxal-disaster-insight-api.hf.space
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
