## 3. Dashboard Features & How to Use Them

### 3.1 Home: The Analytics Overview

The home page provides a high-level summary of global activity and platform status.

**At-a-Glance Metrics:**
-   **Major Events (Last 24h):** A count of significant recent events.
-   **Monitored Countries:** The number of countries included in our historical analysis.
-   **Total Records Analyzed:** The total volume of data processed by our models.

**Platform Status:**
-   **System Health:** A live indicator of the backend API's operational status.
-   **Global Coverage:** Confirms the 24/7 monitoring capability.

---

### 3.2 Live Global Earthquake Feed

This module provides a near real-time view of global seismic activity, powered by the USGS.

**Key Features:**
-   **Automatic Updates:** The data feed refreshes automatically every 60 seconds.
-   **Summary Metrics:** Instantly see the total number of recent events, counts of major (M6.0+) and shallow earthquakes.
-   **Interactive Map & Table:** Explore recent events visually on a global map or sort and filter the detailed data table. Each event includes time, location, magnitude, depth, and a direct link to the USGS report.

> **Use Case:** Achieve rapid situational awareness for ongoing global seismic activity and support immediate response coordination.

### 3.3 Real-Time Signal Analysis (NLP Classifier)

Triage unstructured text in real time to identify critical humanitarian information.

**AI Model:**
-   Powered by a fine-tuned **DistilBERT** Transformer model.
-   Classifies text into one of **10 humanitarian crisis categories**.

**How to Use:**
1.  Enter any text (e.g., a tweet, news headline, or field report) up to 500 characters into the input box.
2.  Click "Analyze".
3.  The model will return the most likely category with a high-confidence score and an interpretation of the label.
4.  Use the "Try Examples" button for a guided exploration of the model's capabilities.

> **Use Case:** Ideal for social media monitoring, filtering high-volume emergency communications, and performing automated first-line screening of unstructured reports.

### 3.4 Event Risk Scenario Planner

Assess the historical risk of a hypothetical disaster event to inform strategic planning.

**AI Model:**
-   An **XGBoost classifier** trained on over 20,000 historical disaster events from the EMDAT database.

**How to Use:**
1.  Use the dropdown menus to define a scenario: select a **Location** (Country/Region), **Disaster Type**, and **Time Period**.
2.  Click "Calculate Risk".
3.  The model will return a precise probability score and a clear risk level (Low, Moderate, High), along with an actionable interpretation.

> **Important Note:** This model is based on historical statistical patterns. It does not account for real-time dynamic factors like current weather, local preparedness, or recent political events.

> **Use Case:** Perfect for "what-if" analysis, strategic resource allocation, and mission readiness planning.

### 3.5 Forecasts: Global & Regional

#### Strategic Global Earthquake Forecast

-   **Model:** A **Prophet** time-series model trained on 50+ years of seismic data.
-   **Output:** A multi-year monthly forecast for the expected number of significant (M6.0+) global earthquakes.
-   **Features:** View the forecast with confidence intervals, analyze the long-term trend, and download the forecast data as a CSV for offline analysis.

> **Use Case:** Supports long-term resource planning, helps identify statistically anomalous months, and provides context for global seismic trends.

#### Tactical Regional Impact Forecast

-   **Model:** A specialized **XGBoost** model trained specifically on four high-risk countries: **China, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines**.
-   **Input:** Use the sliders to input the current quarter's seismic activity (event count, max/avg magnitude).
-   **Output:** A probability (%) of a fatal earthquake occurring in the *next* quarter.

> **Critical Limitations:** This model is a high-precision, low-recall system. An alert is a high-confidence signal, but a "safe" forecast does not guarantee safety. **Do not use for other regions.**

> **Use Case:** Enables targeted, high-consequence preparedness and heightened monitoring for the four focus countries.

## 4. Getting the Most Out of DisasterInsight AI

-   **Combine Tools:** Use the real-time tools (Live Feed, NLP) for immediate triage and the planners/forecasts for strategic decision-making.
-   **Understand the Outputs:** All model outputs are probabilistic forecasts based on historical data, not deterministic predictions of the future.
-   **Stay Updated:** Use the time controls and refresh buttons to ensure you are viewing the most current data.

## 5. Troubleshooting & Support

-   **Slow Loading:** If a feature is slow to load, please wait a moment and refresh the page. The free Hugging Face Spaces servers may "sleep" during periods of inactivity and take a moment to wake up.
-   **Model Errors:** If you encounter a model error, it may be due to temporary backend issues. Please try your request again in a minute.
-   **Feedback & Bug Reports:** For any issues or feature suggestions, please open an issue on our [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/zainafxal/DisasterInsight-AI).
